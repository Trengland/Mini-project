# Team-project - MoveMe Scene
TEAM: Jack, Chris, Chelsea, Sofie, Stephanie, Tiffany



# Project Description 
Have you ever been stuck on a movie night either alone or with freinds never knowing what to watch? What if there was a website that asked simple questions about your situation and recommended movies for you? This was our motivation behind "MoveMe Scene." An interactive website that utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript to recommend movies based on your cicumstances. Our skilled team of budding front-end web developers were able to achieve just that, we want to move you with MoveME.

# How to use our application 
When you load up up the MoveME Scene website you will be directed to a couple questions to narrow down our recommendations, from there you will be presented with a couple movie suggestions along with trailers to help you decide. There is also a like and dislike feature which will log how you felt about the movie you watched and help with future reccomendations.
