# MoveMe Scene - Team Project
TEAM: Jack, Chris, Chelsea, Sofie, Stephanie, Tiffany


## Project Description 
Have you ever been stuck on a movie night, either alone or with friends, not knowing what to watch? What if there was a website that asked simple questions about your situation and recommended movies for you? This was our motivation behind "MoveMe Scene." An interactive website that utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript to recommend movies based on your circumstances. Our skilled team of budding front-end web developers were able to achieve just that. We want to move you, with MoveMe.

## Usage 

### Homepage
The MoveMe Scene webpage can be used to get a list of five movie recommendations or to browse currently trending movies. On the homepage, the user is presented with two buttons, one for the Movie Mood Quiz and one for the Trending Movies Page. These pages can also be reached using our navigation bar at the top of each page. Also in the navbar, the user is able to click the "Sign up for our Weekly Newsletter" button. This button opens a modal allowing user to input their email address. We have also included an easter egg with the VHS tape the bottom of the homepage. When the user hovers over the VHS tape image the tape shakes and clicking the VHS opens a modal containing a random movie quote.

### Movie Mood Quiz
Once the user has reached the Movie Mood Quiz they will select their preferred ratings, release date range, genres, and runtime. The user may fill out as much or as little criteria as desired. Upon submission, this criteria will be used to provide five suggested movies for the user. Each suggested movie will be presented with the movie poster, title, release date, and an overview, as well as a link to a trailer for each movie at the bottom of the screen (if applicable). The user has the option to like and dislike each movie to assist with future recommendations. This quiz can be retaken as many times as desired by clicking the "Take the Quiz Again!" button, navigating to the quiz page in the nav bar, or refreshing the page. 

### Trending Movies Page
When the user navigates to the Trending Movies Page, they are presented with cards containing the top 20 trending movies at that time. These cards show the movie poster, title, and overview.
